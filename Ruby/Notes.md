# Learning Ruby 

8/24 Started learning Ruby with the intention of learning to use with 
Chef.

chef.io is where I am taking training and where many of my notes are stemming from.

## Training Notes
irb sets up the interactive ruby session (so long as ruby is already installed)
ruby -v will check for the version being operated.

In order to add in variables into a string, #{} is used.
 puts is the key word to print anything on a screen when in scripts etc...

string concatination is a thing!!!
	- strings can also be manipulated with: .reverse .length .downcase .upcase

ifelse strings use 'end' in ruby rather than fi

there is also a loop called a unless which uses else and end as well.

### Logic operators...

- && and
- || or
- ! not

### Loops
- while loops exist
- until loops are new and work while conditions are true/false
- for loops exist
