# Learning Ruby 

8/24 Started learning Ruby with the intention of learning to use with 
Chef.

chef.io is where I am taking training and where many of my notes are stemming from.

## Training Notes
irb sets up the interactive ruby session (so long as ruby is already installed)
ruby -v will check for the version being operated.
