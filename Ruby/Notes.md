# Learning Ruby 

8/24 Started learning Ruby with the intention of learning to use with 
Chef.

chef.io is where I am taking training and where many of my notes are stemming from.

## Training Notes
irb sets up the interactive ruby session (so long as ruby is already installed)
ruby -v will check for the version being operated.

In order to add in variables into a string, #{} is used.
 puts is the key word to print anything on a screen when in scripts etc...

string concatination is a thing!!!
	- strings can also be manipulated with: .reverse .length .downcase .upcase

ifelse strings use 'end' in ruby rather than fi

there is also a loop called a unless which uses else and end as well.

### Logic operators...

- && and
- || or
- ! not

### Loops
- while loops exist
- until loops are new and work while conditions are true/false
- for loops exist

### Iterators and Bocks
- need to study blocks some more to understand...Best way for my brain to think about these 
    are like quicker more stylized versions of for loops that will print things in a succession based
    on the brackets.

### Arrays
- similar to C, it appears that the primary way of working with data is arrays
- here to remove pop or delete_at is used.

- another helpful command is .include? This can allow you to search for a specific value within the set.

#### Some additional commands...
- .sort
- .flatten (this is for when its setup like a matrix)
- .each
- .map

Hashes are a thing too! (Go back to Data Engineering for more info on how i've used these in the past)

sets and ranges are unique to Ruby...
