"""
#just like in ARM64, a pound is used for single line commands
#the appropriate ending for a python script is .py as well

#to display something, print is used
#note the minimal syntax for python. no end syntax for lines.
print("hello")

#bool, and most mathematical operations are done the exact same as in C/Cpp
