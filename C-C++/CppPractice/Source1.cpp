/*
Code that should be practiced for EE444, EE443, and probably even CS321. 
All code in here comes primarily from CS 201/202 as well as aditional code 
that I have created in these classes and others.

This practice set is intended to be used as a reference for later code development 
in order to allow me to easily practice, and adjust code that will later be developed.
